\section{Summary}
I'm a Computer Engineer since 2012, but I started programming long time before that. I’m passionate about understanding how things work and what fascinates me most is the world of computing. I consider myself autodidact because I like to learn new technologies and I can do it very quickly. At college, C was the first language I learned, also other programming languages, such as Assembly x86, Java, Shell Script, Python, VHDL and Matlab and protocols as Zigbee and MiWi.

I've been working for a long time as a developer and all the time involving Embedded Systems with Linux. As a result I acquired an extensive knowledge in this field. In the last year I focused my work mainly at device drivers in kernel space. 

I worked in companies with several different technologies and it made me an open minded developer, with can-do attitude and a good interpersonal relationship. I love embedded systems, when it is necessary to do an interface between hardware and software. Currently I’m working with Embbeded Systems, developing the new generation of Digital Fault Recorder in south Brazil, but looking for new challenges around the world.

Development of embedded software for critical applications for electrical systems. We are using buildroot to build a custom embedded Linux. We also use C, Python, device drivers, ShellScript, sockets, multithreading, static code analyzer, Test Driven Development (TDD), U-Boot, Sockets, Modbus, DNP3, NTP, IEC61850 standard, Sampled Values, XML, x86, ARM, SVN, Git, GDB, DMA, interrupts.

We work with full software lifecycle: specification, design, implementation, integration, debug and maintenance. Also software development using Kanban.

Projects that I participated: Digital Fault Recorder with PMU and TWFL (Models RPV 310 and RPV 311, these use x86) and a new generation of Digital Fault Recorder that use ARM.

This company was my first job as a software developer. First I fixed bugs in a project of IP Phone and improved scripts to automate the recording Firmware in the factory. After that, I also worked in other products (ATA and Smartcell). Two years later I started working in a new project to develop the new generation of IP Phone with touch screen, color display, using Blackfin processor with uCLinux distribution. We used U-Boot, GLib, GObject, GDBus, Sofia-SIP as SIP stack, C, ShellScript and jhbuild.

We used Scrum methodology and SVN software versioning.

Projects that participated: IP Phone Mono, IP Phone, color with touch-screen, SmartCell and ATA.
